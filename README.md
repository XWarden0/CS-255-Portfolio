**Summary of the DriverPass Project**
The DriverPass project was for a client who wanted a system to help students prepare for their driving exams. The client, DriverPass, noticed that many students failed their driving tests because they only studied old exam questions. They asked for a system that would let students take online practice exams and also schedule on-the-road driving lessons. My role was to gather the requirements and design a system that meets these needs for students, secretaries, IT staff, and management.
**What I did well**
I think I did well at breaking down the client's requirements into clear diagrams and organized sections in both the business requirements and system design documents. I also explained the diagrams in plain language, which would make it easier for both technical and nontechnical stakeholders to understand the design.
**What would I revise**
If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the class diagram by adding more detail to the relationships and making the roles of each class clearer. This would make it even easier for developers to understand how data should flow through the system when it is implemented.
**Interpreting the User's Needs**
I carefully looked at what each type of user needed from the system. For example, students needed to schedule lessons and take practice tests, secretaries needed to reset accounts. I turned these needs into diagrams and requirements that directly match the client's requests. It's important to focus on user needs because if the system doesn't work for them, it won't be successful.
**My approach to designing software**
My approach is to start with requirements and then build diagrams that clearly show how the system should work. I like to use UML diagrams because they help break down the system from different perspectives, like use cases, activities, and classes. In the future, I plan to keep using these strategies, but I also want to include more feedback from users during the design phase so the system refelcts their real expereiences and expectations.
