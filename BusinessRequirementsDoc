Business Requirements Document – DriverPass
System Components and Design

Purpose
- Client: DriverPass (Owner: Liam, IT Officer: Ian)
- Purpose: Design a web-based system that provides students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training scheduling to improve their chances of passing their driving test.
- The system must allow access to data from any computer or mobile device, support reservations for lessons, track training progress, and stay updated with DMV requirements.

System Background
- DriverPass identified a market gap in comprehensive driver training – more than 65% of students fail because they only study past exams.
- Goal: Offer both online study tools and in-person/on-road lessons.
- Need a centralized, secure, cloud-based platform for lesson scheduling, account management, online testing, and integration with DMV updates.
- Components:
   - Online class and practice test system
   - Lesson scheduling/reservation system
   - Role-based account management for employees and customers
   - DMV connection for policy updates
   - Reporting and activity tracking features

Objectives and Goals
- Provide online classes and practice tests with progress tracking
- Allow customers to make, cancel, and modify reservations online or through staff.
- Track lesson assignments with drivers, cars, times, and package details.
- Maintain flexible package management (enable/disable packages)
- Generate activity and performance reports for management
- Enable technician/IT admin roles for account resets, access control, and security
- Ensure compliance with DMV updates and notify users of changes

- Dependent on DMV cooperation for content updates
- Limited by budget and timeline as outlined in project schedule
